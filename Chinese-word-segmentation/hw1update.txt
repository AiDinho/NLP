Subject: hw1 files updated

I've updated hw1 files. please refresh your copy with the one on the web page or the ~anoop/cmpt413/hw1 directory on fraser.sfu.ca

The description of q1, q2 and q5 has been improved. 

For q5 you must start with virahanka_stub.py and copy it to your answer directory as answer/virahanka.py 

This version auto-detects the absence of recursion in virahanka.py, so do not modify anything outside the virahanka function else we cannot auto-check your submission.
