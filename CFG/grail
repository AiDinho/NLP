pull the other one !
#I feel fine !
you 're not fooling anyone y' know .
I feel happy ... I feel happy .
I 'm thirty seven -- I 'm not old !
you 're fooling yourself .
we 're living in a dictatorship .
we 're an anarcho-syndicalist .
but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting .
I order you to be quiet !
well , 'ow did you become king then ?
I mean , if I went around sayin' I was an emperor just because some moistened bink had lobbed a scimitar at me they 'd put me away !
ah , now we see the violence inherent in the system .
oh !
come and see the violence inherent in the system !
help ! 
I 'm being repressed !
bloody peasant !
you fight with the strength of many men , Sir Knight .
none shall pass .
I move for no man .
come on you pansy !
victory is mine !
what are you going to do , bleed on me ?
you 're a loony .
all right ; we 'll call it a draw .
I 'll bite your legs off !
we have found a witch , might we burn her ?
well , on second thought , let 's not go to Camelot .
it is a silly place .
that is your purpose , Arthur ...  the quest for the Holy Grail .
go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest .
I blow my nose at you , so-called Arthur King , you and all your silly English knnnniggets .  
thppppt !
what a strange person .
now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a !
ah , this one is for your mother !
run away !
